# english-to-hindi-translator-model
This project implements an English to Hindi Translator using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques based on Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention mechanism. It uses TensorFlow/Keras  to train a deep learning model on parallel English-Hindi corpora.
🚀 Features
Translates English sentences into fluent Hindi.

Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention.

Preprocessing: tokenization, padding, and text cleaning.

Trained on open parallel corpus (e.g., IIT Bombay English-Hindi dataset).

BLEU score evaluation for translation accuracy.
📦 Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

NLTK / spaCy for preprocessing

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Model Architecture
Encoder: Embedding + LSTM/GRU

Decoder: Embedding + LSTM/GRU with Attention

Trained using Teacher Forcing

📁 Dataset
Uses publicly available datasets like:

IIT Bombay English-Hindi Corpus
